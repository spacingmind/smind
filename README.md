**Space for your agents, free for you.**

sMind is a self-hosted platform for running coding agents, built around
per-workspace account routing so you can spread agent traffic across your own
provider accounts instead of a single shared pool. It ships as a single Go
binary that serves both the API and an embedded web UI.

> **Status: early / pre-1.0.** The core daemon, CLI, and web UI are usable
> day to day, but expect rough edges and breaking changes before `v1`. See
> [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's done and what's next.

## Features

- **Multi-account routing** — spread requests across your own Anthropic,
  OpenAI, and other provider accounts with session affinity and automatic
  failover, instead of relying on a single shared credential.
- **Workspace → Space → Task model** — each task runs in a real, isolated
  `git worktree`.
- **Multiple agent backends** — drives agents over the [Agent Client
  Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (GLM and other ACP-speaking
  agents) or Claude Code's native headless protocol, behind one unified
  interface.
- **Embedded web UI** — agent chat timeline, a file explorer with a
  CodeMirror editor, a real diff viewer, an embedded terminal (real PTY),
  and inline permission prompts — all driven over a single WebSocket
  connection to the daemon.
- **CLI** — `workspace`/`space`/`task` management and `task
  send`/`attach`/`logs`/`stop`, modeled on real-world daemon CLIs (detaching
  never stops a run in progress).

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/spacingmind/smind/cmd/smind@latest
```

## Quickstart

```sh
smind serve                                          # start the daemon (http://localhost:4648)
smind workspace create /path/to/repo "my project" hard
smind task new <workspaceId> "fix the failing test"
smind task send <taskId> glm "fix the failing test"   # or open the web UI and use the Chat tab
```

## Dev quickstart

```sh
task build      # build the web UI, then the smind binary (bin/smind)
task dev:web    # run the Vite dev server, proxying /healthz to :4648
task dev:go     # run the Go daemon
task test       # go test ./... (plus the web UI's test suite)
task lint       # go vet + gofmt check
```
